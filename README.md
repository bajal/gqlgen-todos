### gqlgen todo app

Familiarizing with gqlgen - following the getting started guide [here](https://gqlgen.com/getting-started/)

```
go mod init github.com/bajal/gqlgen-todos
go get github.com/99designs/gqlgen
go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen init   # This creates a gqlgen.yml config file
and the /graph folder
```

##### Notes
* When executed, gqlgen’s `generate` command compares the schema file (graph/schema.graphqls) with the models graph/model/*, and, wherever it can, it will bind directly to the model.
* The `graph/resolver.go` file is where we declare our app’s dependencies, like our database. It gets initialized once in `server.go` when we create the graph.


After running the server (`go run server.go`), we can go to localhost:8080 and run following mutation and query:
```
mutation createTodo{
  createTodo(input:{text:"todo1", userId: "1"}) {
    user {
      id
    }
    text
    done
  }
}

query findTodos {
  todos {
    text
    done
    user {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

After editing a schema, model can be regenerated by
`go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate .`
